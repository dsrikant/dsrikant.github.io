### ... You make a meringue

My name is Dushyant Srikant. I love cooking, cats, golf and just about anything do with computers.

I'm currently based out of Chicago, after finally making it out of California after 23 years.

When I'm not at home cooking for my ever hungry family, or out golfing with friends, I'm usually finding something fun to read or a new tv show to watch.

I haven't been to nearly as many different places as I wish I have. So I've made it a personal
goal of mine to make it to at least 3 different countries by the time I'm 30.

I hope the seemingly random thoughts I leave on these pages, provide insight into something you may not have thought of or had explained in a certain way before.

Yours Truly,
