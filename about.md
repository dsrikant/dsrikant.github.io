### ... You make a meringue

My name is Dushyant Srikant. I love cooking, cats, golf and just about anything do with computers.

I'm currently based out of Chicago, after finally making it out of California after 23 years.

When I'm not at home cooking for my ever hungry family, out on the links with friends, I can usually be found at the gym, working off the day.

I enjoy watching sports with a couple of cold beers and potatoes, but would take a weekend away, with my wonderful girlfriend, over that any day.

I graduated in 2015 from the University of California San Diego. I'm currently working at kCura as a Software Engineer. Anything related to crypto and security or machine learning/ AI are great topics for drinks with me.

I hope the seemingly random thoughts I leave on these pages, provide insight into something you may not have thought of or had explained in a certain way before.

Yours Truly,
