For over a year I sat quietly and watched as an infection grew in this country.
It took hold of people slowly but surely and crept its way into our daily
lives. It was all late night talk shows could mock. It was all morning news
could report. And it was all social media could create memes about.

We laughed this infection off, as if it was no bigger than a paper cut at work; no
more painful than a singe from hot oil as we were frying our eggs.

We laughed this infection off with friends, with family, at parties, at work and in bed
at night. We laughed it off to avoid having to think about the reality of actually
having to subject ourselves to a thorough diagnosis.

This infection that makes us shoot unarmed citizens because of the color of their skin.
This infection that makes us allow men to get off with a pat on the wrist for rape.
This infection that justifies paying a woman less than a man, for doing the same job.
This infection that blinds us to the struggles of those who are not as lucky to be citizens
our country.

This infection that has now taken the popular vote and the electoral vote.

This infection is nothing new. This infection has existed for thousands of years.
And we have all sat on the sidelines allowing it to fester.

Ignorance.

Ignoring the kid at the lunch table because the food she brought for lunch was
something you've never seen before.
Ignoring the only woman in the meeting room because she can't speak up enough to
be heard over the ruckus.
Ignoring entire communities that are struggling to keep jobs with all of the
automation being instituted in the manufacturing industry.

Ignoring the problems other human beings around us are facing, is what led us to elect
the most complete embodiment of racism, sexism and bigotry the public eye has ever seen.

Let's really make America great again. What we need is not something a government can
give us. What we need is to be able to look at the people around us, ALL of the
people around us, and see the greatness in them. America is only as great as her people.
I choose to see greatness in every single American.

Some may choose to run. But I'm not going anywhere.

This is my country to protect.
